# Paidly — Smart Payment Reminder App

Paidly is a modern Android application developed using Jetpack Compose, designed to help users manage, track, and receive reminders for payments—whether they are dues to be paid or collected. With a color-coded UI, recurring reminder support, and notification alerts, Paidly simplifies personal finance tracking in an efficient and intuitive way.
